Things that we still need for the API:

- Get distinct room numbers (by the specified building) (GET REQUEST) ( collection.distinct(...) )

- Get room types (maybe by building name and number?) (GET REQUEST) ( collection.find(...) )

- Get unapproved requests (GET REQUEST) ( collection.find(...) )

- Get approved requests (GET REQUEST) ( collection.find(...) )

- Update requests to approved (using the  document ID) (PUT REQUEST) ( collection.update(...) )

- Delete requests when denied approval (DELETE REQUEST) ( collection.delete(...) )

- Store new requests (POST REQUEST) ( collection.insert(...) )

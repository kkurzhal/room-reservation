Things that we still need for the API:

- Get distinct room numbers (by the specified building)

- Get room types (maybe by building name and number?)

- Get unapproved requests

- Get approved requests

- Update requests to approved (using the  document ID)

- Delete requests when denied approval

- Store new requests
